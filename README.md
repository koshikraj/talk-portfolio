## Installation
1. For first time user, you have to install Ruby and Rails. If you do not have Ruby on Rails installed, you may follow [this tutorial](http://melvinchng.github.io/rails/RubyOnRailsInstallation.html) that I wrote for Windows, Linux, and MacOS (installation videos are included).
2. Install Jekyll by using the command `gem install jekyll`.
3. Start your localhost server by using the command `jekyll serve`. Make sure that you are at the root directory of your folder before using this command.
4. Your site should be accessible at `localhost:4000`.
5. For additional information about Jekyll, refer to the [official website](http://jekyllrb.com/).
